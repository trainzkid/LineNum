# LineNum
*A simple command line application that adds line numbers before lines of text either piped in or via files provided as arguments. Basically just a "modern" c++ rewrite of the c utility written by @FreeDOSProject during his video titled ["Linux like original UNIX"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0pXQVMC770). *
